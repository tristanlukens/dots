# dots

My dotfiles.

---

I used to just put all config files without real organisation, then went over to [Zach Holman's way of managing them](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/), but now decided to mirror my home directory's structure and use GNU `stow` to manage symlinks.

Since my last dotfiles project, I've come to the conclusion that I don't need a lot of what I've got configured. Therefore this project is a lot smaller. I have however not written install scripts for everything â€” maybe Holman's way *is* the better way. I like `stow` tho, so *ik zie wel waar het schip strandt*.

Maybe I'll find a hybrid way to do it.

Also: I've kept alive the old project but renamed it to `dotfiles_old`.
