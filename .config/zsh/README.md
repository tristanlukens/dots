My zsh config.

It's split up into `zshrc`, `config` and `aliases`. `zshrc` and `aliases` are pretty self-explanatory, `config` is for configurations of terminal programs which are set using enviroment variables.

## Todo

- [ ] check if order in zshrc doesn't make for bugs
- [ ] add completions for some functions (including ga and gc)
- [ ] zsh-autosuggestions
- [ ] show hidden files in fzf (or write a seperate function with that in mind)
- [ ] show hidden files with tab completions
