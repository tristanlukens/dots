My zsh config.

It's split up into `zshrc`, `config` and `aliases`. `zshrc` and `aliases` are pretty self-explanatory, `config` is for configurations of terminal programs which are set using enviroment variables.

## Todo

- [ ] fzf doesn't work when sourcing its setup script where I want to source it
- [ ] check if order in zshrc doesn't make for bugs
- [ ] add completions for some functions (including ga and gc)
- [ ] zsh-autosuggestions
- [ ] fix vim color in starship
