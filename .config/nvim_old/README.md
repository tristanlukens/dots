My own nvim configuration. Not as an ide this time; but rather as a simple terminal text editor with nice keybindings and some qol plugins. Maybe one day it will evolve into a pde (personal development enviroment, according to TJ). I guess we'll see.

Many times have I tried to switch to nvim as my primary development area, but I always go back to vscode. Sue me. It's good.

Therefore I have no use for nvim to be set up as a state of the art ide. Why would I set it up that way? That is a question I asked myself this morning. Well... I won't. End of story.
